Q 1 : What is an Algorithms ? What do you understand about it ?

      ...................................................


Q 2 : Why we need an algorithms ? What is the advantages and disadvantages of it ?

      ...................................................
      ...................................................


Q 3 : What is the characterstics of an algorithms ? explain any three property which should must be in it ? 
Ans : ...................................................
      ...................................................
      ...................................................


Q 4 : How can we compare between two algorithms written for the same problem?

Ans : The complexity of an algorithm is a technique that is used to categorise that how efficient our algorithm
as compare to other algorithms. It is focuses that the input size of the data set require how much time to execute 
and how much space need to store. So it to be a good idea to categorise our algorithms according to how much time
or space they take up.
Complexity of Time : require time to run an algorith is called complexity of time.
Complexity of Space : require space to store an algorith is called complexity of space.


Periority               Time                        A1                          A2                    PICK

First                   Average Case                Go To High                 Go To Low               A2

Second                  Worth Case                  Go To Low                   Go To High              A1

Third                   Best Case                   Go To Low                    Go To Low             A1 || A2


1 => average case => if equal
2 => worth case => if equal
3 => best case => if equal

IF all tie than we should go for space complexity
and if it is also tie than we use any of them



Q 5 : What you think about space complexity and time complexity. which is more important in it

Ans : .........................................................................................
      .........................................................................................
      Nowadays, a lack of space is rarely not an issue because computer storage to become very large as day by day but time 
      is fixed which is 24 hours in a day. So we should give more importance to time complexity when we evaluate an Algorithm.


Q 6 : How can we represent our complexity OR we calculate our complexity

Ans : mostly there are three types of complexity stages we use to represent our code complrxity which is worth case senario , 
average case senario and best case senario 
in worth case : ........................................................................... max time
in average case : ......................................................................... average time
in best case senario : .................................................................... less time

and to represent these all senarios we use mathematical way which is called asmpotatic notations.

And for calculation, Generally we use functions which could be any type like 
constant functions : O(1)
linear : .................................
quadratic : ......................................
logrithms functions : ................................
Exponancial : 
etc.




Q 7 : plz explain these all cenarios with suitable example

Ans : Best Case Scenario of an Algorithm : The best-case scenario for an algorithm is defined as if we have a data arrangement and
we want to perform some operations over it than we can say that our algorithm performs the best if we find our desired result at 
first operations. 
for example, take a binary example where the best-case scenario is if the target value is present very centre of the data which we are
looking for. Than we find it at first operations now we can say our algorithms is best case

Average case : ...................................

if we find our target in mid of no. of operations performed

worth case ..............................

if we find our target value in last



Q 8 : tell me something about these functions in term of growth and how we set in a increasing list

Ans : growth of function ...........................................................

increaseing orders list : 

constant => logirithms => linear => Quadratic => exponicial => factorial => odral polynomial

O(1) => O(log n) => O(n) => O( n * log n ) => O(n*n) => O( n^2 log n ) => O(n^3) .......... => O( k ^ n ) => O( n ! ) ..............

* : exponicial show high growth as compare to polynomial functions

K ^ n  >>>>>>>>>>>>  n ^ k        // here k is contant
